*How we feeling tonight??*
**The Walls seem to be a bit tight tonight**
# I don't exactly know why, but they're drifting in and out of my sight
## but that's alright, I don't exactly mind with the lights
> It's a terrible fright, with no comfort of flight
* Purple, blue, or white
* it's all the same in the end
* when you're drifting like a kite
1. There's no use trying to stop the bend
2. It's quick and quiet with a matching bite
3. But all dressed up just like a friend
---
`Don't be afraid it's in us all`
```
And it's here to stay so don't try to fight
A soul all one, what's shared is spared and on the mend
Just look inside at what is light and follow all that's bright
```
